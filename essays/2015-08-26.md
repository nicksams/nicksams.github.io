I majored in MIS mainly because I love technology and experiencing new technologies as well. When I went into MIS I wanted to become a Project manager in the technology industry. Currently I work for Decision Research Corporation and I love what I do. DRC's main function is to create web portals for insurance companies underwriters to create claims and process the insurance properly. Web application is something I believe is very important in the career of a MIS major. I hope to learn a lot more concepts that will further me in my career!
