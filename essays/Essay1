BrowserHistory 1,2 and 3 were very interesting because it sets the foundation to learn and progress in the creation of our websites. In all of the WODs I completed the tasks with a rating of Rx because I took the time to study and practice the WODs multiple times so I knew exactly what I was doing. In doing them multiple times I was not because I did not know what to do but I would only strive to get a rating of Rx and nothing less. Something that worked well for me and cut down on time was that when I knew there was multiple sections with the same format I would copy and paste the variable that I already created to the areas that I needed to because it would keep the formatting the same and made sure that I did not miss any of the formatting errors. After completing them I would agree that I have the skills to know the information!

My advice is that you should complete the WOD with the screencast side by side so you can understand exactly what you are doing with the assistance of the professor who is teaching the WOD. After understanding what you are doing you are now ready to do the WOD on your own and get the perfect Rx score that we are all striving for.
