The WOD that I just completed was the Invoice1 WOD and that one was much more complex than the other WODS that we did prior to this one. Because of the complexity of this WOD my reccomendation is to do this WOD multuiple times before recording yourself as it is harder then the last ones. Things that worked well was my understanding of the things we needed to do for example creating variables and making sure I use them and call them by name throughout the file rather than hard coding them. Things that did not work so well was creating the table. This was hard because I did not really fully grasp what we were supposed to do in the beginning but as I worked with the screencast and worked on it more and more I started to get faster and faster at the WOD. What I did to prepare for this WOD was exactly the same as previous ones, watch the screencast, research how to use opreators properly, review inclass material. Things I could have done differently would be to do and work on the WOD not one day before its due haha.
